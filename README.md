# BHHI Methods Meetup

A repository for slides from the BHHI quantitative data team's Methods Meetups.

New presentations should be placed in their own folder following the naming convention: `XX-name-of-presentation`.

The project is configured as a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and each slide deck should be a [revealjs Quarto presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).

To update the website with the finished presentation run: `quarto publish gh-pages` in the terminal from the project root.

Presentations should be developed on their own branch and then merged to main.
